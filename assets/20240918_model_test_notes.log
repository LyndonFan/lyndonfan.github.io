The 2024 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad and officially branded as Paris 2024, is an international multi-sport event taking place from 24 July to 11 August 2024 in France, with the opening ceremony having taken place on 26 July. Paris is the host city, with events held in 16 additional cities spread across Metropolitan France, and one subsite in Tahiti, French Polynesia.

Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris becomes the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the 1908, 1948, and 2012 Games). Paris 2024 marks the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924 (which in turn marks the centenary of the Winter Olympics) and is the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first French Olympics since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Paris 2024 features the debut of breakdancing as an Olympic sport, and will be the final Olympic Games held during the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach. The 2024 Games are expected to cost â‚¬9 billion.

# Desert Island Docker

"which 3 Docker Images would you bring up a desert island?"

Also won't be advanced

## What's Docker?

- LIKE a virtual machine
  - but too many things
  - also can't boot more than 1
- Docker is between PC and VM

## Python Image

- image similar to a mold / cookie cutter
- container similar to cookie
- image from registry (E.g Docker Hub)

### Mechanics

- pull image then run
- pull
  - series of steps
  - corresponds to layers
- run
  - nothing back?
  - not interactive by default
- tags
  - specify which version of the image
  - e.g. have to run python 2
  - can pull python 2 Docker image

### Containers are Sealed

- can punch holes
- mount (-v) files 
- port (-p) to expose

### Tags

- have many
- check OS
- check size requirements
  - alpine: real small

## Jupyter

- eg jupyter/minimal-notebook
- need to mount $(pwd)
- have to expose port 8888
- works, but no modules

### Dockerfile

- build in top of your own 

FROM jupyter/minimal-notebook
RUN pip install numpy

## Tensorflow

- hard to config
- easy for CPU
- more legwork for GPU
 - just check it's there
 - then tell docker how many GPUs it can use

## Q&A

- architecture of computers matter?
  - yes
  - pick right image tag
  - much better than installing Tensorflow yourself
- not run pull before run?
  - does it if image isn't there
