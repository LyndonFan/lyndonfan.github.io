I'm a recent Oxford graduate working as a data engineer in the UK. I like to use data to find interesting facts, or just play around with technologies.

My first (and best) language is Cantonese, followed by English and Python. I have also dabbled with javascript, and am picking up the basics of Go.

I also really like [Magic: the Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering).
