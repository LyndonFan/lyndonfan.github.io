It's the big changes in life that impact you the most.

I switched my jobs recently, which doesn't sound much on its own. Yet, considering I'm only 1.5 years out of university, and don't have a lot of "great internships" on my CV, it's a bold move in a market where tech layoffs are the news. Regardless, when I evaluated the position I was in last year, it was a logical choice.

During my job search, I applied to a wide range of positions, as I wanted to see what other positions and companies could offer. I haphazardly cast a wide net, from machine learning engineers to fullstack developers, from finance to Sainsburys (as a data scientist). But where I settled on now has a much larger scale than my previous company, both in terms of the company size and its codebase. It uses a different cloud stack, a different working culture, and a much longer roll out time. In my previous company, to roll out to production only required a simple

```text
git checkout test && git merge dev && git push
git checkout prod && git merge test && git push
```

All done in less than a minute. Now? You better expect your code to be fully tested, which also includes deployment and rollback. Breaking things in production and affect people's lives. Literally.

This isn't to say small companies are a lot faster and big companies are slow and stuck in a well, it's only to say it's a vastly different environment I've flung myself into, and now I have to learn my ropes. Were I to stay in my old position, I wouldn't get the chance to push myself.

It's the big changes that shape your life.

In my final year at university, aside from finishing my dissertation, I focused on finding a job. I initially looked for jobs in Hong Kong to fulfill the conditions of my scholarship, and even suceeded at getting one. With that settled, all I had to do was to focus on my studies, wait for the graduation certificate, fly back home, and start my new job.

As summer rolled around and I was wrapping up my work at top speed<!--read frantically-->, I re-evaluated my situation. I could go back to Hong Kong and walk a relatively smooth life, or I could start my career right in the UK. Due to a wide variety of circumstances, my interest in staying the UK massively increased over my four years here, and continuing straight out of university seemed sensible. What better time than to find a job in the UK than right after you graduate at a UK university?

So, instead of relaxing over the summer, I spent it doing another internship and looking for full-time positions. It wasn't fun, but was better than waiting for a job to land on my lap. With some effort and luck, I managed to find the data engineer position.

What would my career be like had I took on the job in Hong Kong? No idea -- it's a different title, company, and phyiscal location. What I can say is my life in general has changed. In Hong Kong, I can live at my parents', not worry about finances, and rely on my social circle. Now, I have balance all that on top of my career. That's probably just another way to spell "being an adult".

I'm fairly sure I won't be here as I am (both physically and otherwise) if it weren't for these big changes.
