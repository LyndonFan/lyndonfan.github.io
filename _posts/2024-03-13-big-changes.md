It's the big changes in life that matter.

I switched my jobs recently, which doesn't sound much on its own. But considering I'm only 1.5 years out of university, and don't have a great CV, it's a bold move when layoffs in tech are the news. Regardless, when I evaluated the position last year, it was the logical choice.

During my job search, I applied to a wide range of positions, as I wanted to see what other positions and companies could offer. I haphazardly casted a wide net, from machine learning engineers to fullstack developers, from finance to Sainsbury's (as a data scientist). But where I settled on now has a much larger scale -- both in company size and its codebase. It uses a different cloud stack, a different working culture, and a much longer roll out time. In my previous company, to roll out to production only required a simple

```text
git checkout test && git merge dev && git push
git checkout prod && git merge test && git push
```

All done in less than a minute. Now? You better expect your code to be fully tested, including deployment and rollback. Breaking things in production is much more costly and could affect people's lives. Literally.

To be clear, I'm definitely not saying small companies are a lot faster and big companies are slow and stuck in a well. It's just a vastly different environment I've flung myself into, and now I have to re-learn my ropes. Were I to stay in my old position, I might not have the chance to push myself.

It's the big changes that shape your life.

In my final year at university, aside from finishing my dissertation, I focused on finding a job. I initially looked for jobs in Hong Kong to fulfill the conditions of my scholarship, and suceeded at getting one. With that settled, all I had to do was to focus on my studies, wait for the graduation, fly back home, and start my new job.

As summer rolled around and I was wrapping up my work at top speed<!--read frantically-->, I re-evaluated my situation. I could go back to Hong Kong and walk a relatively smooth life, _or_ I could start my career right in the UK. Due to a variety of circumstances, my interest in staying the UK massively increased over my four years here. What better time than to find a job in the UK than right after you graduate at a university there?

Instead of relaxing over the summer, I spent it doing another internship and looking for full-time positions while on my graduate visa. It wasn't fun, but was better than waiting for a job to land on my lap. With some effort and luck, I managed to find the data engineer position.

What would my career be like had I returned to Hong Kong? No idea -- it's a different title, company, and phyiscal location. What I can say is the rest of my life has changed. In Hong Kong, I can live at my parents' place, not worry about finances, and have a decent social life. Now, I have to balance all that on top of my career. That's probably just another way to spell "being an adult".

I'm fairly sure I won't be here as I am (both physically and otherwise) if it weren't for these big changes.

Unless...?
