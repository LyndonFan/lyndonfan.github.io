Dear Lyndon,

Hope your past year has gone well. In case you forgot, I wrote this last year to catch up and see how things went for you / will go for me. [The last time I did this](LINK), I went for a full review, but I might do it a bit looser this time. Partly because I don't think it's necessary, partly since it's late at night as I do this (as usual) and I'm a bit tired.

## How's work and your career?

As I write this, we just had a new starter joining us. It's a bit exciting to see someone go through a similar process as I did half a year ago -- how time flies! I'm glad to ~~not wait for other people to approve my PRs~~get more people to work on larger projects.

So, how is it one year after? Hopefully your team has done amazing things and not broken prod. You might have also got some certificates / proof to show your achievements, and even use other languages or tools for your work.

Outside of your job, have you done anything exciting? Maybe it's another personal project, or finding more meetups. I'm working on something right now and aim to finish it this week, so let me know if that worked out.

## What's up with your hobbies?

I've picked up [Blood on the Clocktower](LINK) recently -- what about you? And any changes to your other existing hobbies? I remember I used to make paper origami quite a lot, but it dropped off after COVID as I moved back to the UK for university. Probably because it wasn't very practical to move the models between flats.

## Any special things you've done?

Outside of regular hobbies, have you done anything special?

I just had my final canoe lesson last weekend. I canoed on the Thames river which I crossed often when I went to Reading town center. It's wild how being on the river gives you such a different perspective. I kid you not, I was filled with joy and a bit surprised at how much that delighted me. I also fell in the water as the coaches gave me a slimmer boat and more effeicient oars (the Raven and raven wings? TO_CHECK) to try out. "Of course", as I laughed it off and worked to empty the cockpit.

Goodness, that was a great session to end on.

Enough of me sharing what you already knew. What about you?

## How are your friends & family?

_(I'm intentionally being a bit vague here, just because I'm not very linclined to expose all my personal life on the public.)_

Carrying over last year, any changes with your support network? Moving in with friends definitely changed things for me, so maybe you will have similar changes. Or just getting more British friends?

## Any long term plans?

Just because it's more casual doesn't mean I won't ask the same questions, mate.

I'm not sure if setting a goal works for us. The benefit is an obvious target, though set it too low and you'll be lost afterwards, while set it too high and you'll hardly achieve it. Any concrete plans or timelines might be easily disrupted by other life changing events, which you are inclined to take anyways.

Instead, do you have a direction you want to go?

How specific is up to you. Like with goals, you probably want a middle ground: too broad and it's meaningless (e.g. keep being a programmer is a for-sure), while too narrow and it's easy to deviate outside it (e.g. be a Python only Platform Engineer).

Alternatively, you've already jotted what your future looks like, and work backwards. 

Or I'm just rambling again and none of this makes sense to you.

Anyways, I'm looking to your response.

Best regards,

Lyndon
