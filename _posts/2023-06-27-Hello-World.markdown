Hi there! Guess I’m new here, so let me introduce myself.

## Who are you?

I’m Lyndon Fan, a recent graduate now working as a data engineer in the UK. I’m interested in how data can tell stories and influence our lives — especially with the advance in AI (cough GPT-4 cough).

## Where am I?

You’re at my blog. This is (well, will be) the place where I post my thoughts and articles on a variety of things.

## What will you write about?

Pretty much what I have in mind. Some programming stuff, some personal thoughts, and occasionally things from my own life. The last two might feel a bit rambly, but that’s what I’m starting with. (Plus I can say it’s my style).

## Why start now?

First and foremost, I want to document my journey more. Having only started my first proper job ~~six~~ nine months ago, I’m eager to see where I will be in a year, five years, and even further. It’s not just career-wise, too. COVID has made my uni life quite unpredictable, and with that out of the way, I would like to see how my post-uni life turns out.

The other major reason is for me to jot down what I’ve learnt — on the job or outside of it. Sure, there are tons of tutorials and articles, and reading the documentation (almost) always explains the code. But that probably won’t be enough for me to keep it all in my head. The Feyman technique, active recall, and tonnes of other learning methods all involve rephrasing the concept you are learning until you remember or rephrase it. I’ll try my best to explain things, and hey, maybe you’ll discover something new as well!

Also, I’m seeing people around me do it. A couple friends from uni (hi [Oscar](https://oscarmui.github.io/) and [Toby](https://tobylam.xyz/)) as well as a friend from work (hi [Nathan](https://algonate.com/)) have their own personal website for different reasons, but having a life to jot down my thoughts on variety of topics sounds like a good idea.

Finally, because I want to :D

No, seriously, I’ve been thinking of doing something like this last year, but I never got around to do it. Being flooded with assignments while working on my dissertation is not a great time to start a new personal project. With my hectic uni life over (replaced by a thankfully more regular job) I have some geniue free time on my hands to branch off into something new.

## How can I find you?

You already have! Alternatively, find me on [Github](https://github.com/LyndonFan), [LinkedIn](), or [email](mailto:lyndon0808@gmail.com?subject=Hello).

## When can I see you again?

Every 1-2 Wednesdays. I'll try to keep the posts between short but empty and way too long, and write at least 1 technical post every month.
