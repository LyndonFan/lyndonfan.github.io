A quick post but I just finished building a note taking app!

_Isn't that just a basic CRUD app?_

Okay, that wasn't the best start. But what if I told you it had a search engine that allows you to find notes by meaning?

If you're interested, take a look at the video of me doing a demo here:

Or check out the [Aether repo](https://github.com/LyndonFan/Aether).

I just finished publishing and polishing this minutes ago, but will be making another post about my process of _technically_ publishing something in a month.

Until then, I need a break.
