Okay, I could have called this post "Take More Risks", but it's a bit less exciting, innit?

I've taken risks more than usual lately, and it wasn't that bad. Knowing some people are less likely to take risks and/or are conservative (no not the party), I've got some anecdotes for you to think about.

## Once in a Lifetime

_Come, one and all, to the best roulette tables you will ever find!_

Some opportunities occur rarely, like [the massive spike in solar activity that allowed people in the UK to see the northern lights](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68995281). I only heard about it at 12:30 that night, but eventually decided it was worth a shot. After an hour of walking around my neighbourhood and realising I had to set my camera with longer exposure, I actually got some photos of the Aurora.

Maybe it's one of your friends from years ago who had gone to study in the US and was visiting Oxford (hi [CCL](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ching-lam-choi/)!). It took me a while to start contacting her, but during the night out we caught up with each other, and I introduced the place where I studied and called home. Besides the nice bubble tea, it was interesting to see how our paths evolved. 

These opportunities don't come often, but when they do, you know they will be hard to get by. Sometimes the news just tells you, but more often you can figure it out. Maybe it's travelling around Europe before starting uni, or perhaps [it's starting your adult life in another country](./2024-03-13-big-changes.md). Some are wacky advnetures, but others may be irrevesible. Regardless, if you do take the chance, and things do work out for you, you could...

## Win Big

_Grab one of our many coveted prizes!_

Look at the payout table. Find the prizes with a decent chance of winning. If they seem attractive, just go for it.

Back when I was a ~~wee kid~~ high schooler, I never really considered going overseas to study. The local unis were good even worldwide, but not as well-known as Harvard or Cambridge. Imagine the surprise I had when one of my teachers suggested I should apply to Oxford! After a few rounds of persuasion, I went along with it. For the following summer, I worked with my teachers to frantically whip up a good personal statement for UCAS, and drilled for the aptitude tests and interviews. Eventually, I got a conditional offer and was overjoyed. It was definitely a life-changing prize.

Another occasion was when I wanted to attend a PyData event hosted by my friend (hi [Tom](https://github.com/TomBurdge)!) in Cambridge. It was in the evening on a workday and quite a distance away (train tickets aren't cheap), but after some persuasion, I got to leave work early and stay at his place afterwards. Not only did I attend the event and learn various fun stuff (note to self: write up on more events), we also had great conversations -- both technical and otherwise. It may not look like much, but personally, it was a great experience.

## Nothing to Lose

_Our tickets are cheaper than you think!_

The costs of taking on a risk sound hefty, but often are not.

The most common costs are time and money. Money can often be recovered or saved from other places, so (personally) it should not be an issue as long as it's reasonable. Time can't be recovered easily, but if you weren't planning to do anything with it, going for a chance encounter is arguably saving the lost time.

I used to not really do anything outside of work. Buy some groceries, clean the house, and meet up with my friends occassionally. But overall it was a bit dull. Last summer, I went to a D&D session organised by the local board game shop. It was pretty fun, and afterwards I learnt there are weekly sessions hosted in a nearby pub. I decided to attend one, and now it's part of my schedule. It wasn't free, it took up my entire Tuesday evenings, but it has been more fun than staying home and binging Youtube.

The other common costs are relationships. Sometimes, things turn ugly; but they were often just a matter of time. In other cases, you just get a "no", and everyone moves on.

## Playing is its Own Reward

_Just by joining, you're already part of the spectacle!_

Statistically, you can't win every single time. That's just how probability works.

However, you often get away with a consolation prize, and it's called "learning a lesson". You might fail a job interview, but preparing for it can help you in your job search, and its assignment can be good practice for your coding and problem solving skills. You might go to a networking event and not make any connections, but having talked to multiple people will prepare you for other social encounters. <!--What do you mean small talk is easy?--> Didn't win anything in a hackathon? Remeber it's already a 24-hour adrenaline-fueled event with food, stash, accommodation, and entertainment. Also, you now know what others have done to win.

Even if you don't get to play again, it could still be an invaluable experience. I only applied to Oxford when one of my teachers encouraged me, and eventually received an invitation to have the final interviews in person. It was my first visit to the UK, and I was captivated by the snow when I arrived in Oxford. I also got to live in _the_ Oxford colleges! I reckon even if I didn't get into Oxford, it was still a tale to look back on.

## \<call-to-action>

_So what are you waiting for? Go bet on it!_

Risks turn people away due to their nature, but the reward could be worth it. You'll often get something out of it -- it might even be life changing. To put it another way, you don't want to be on your deathbed, utter, "I wish I'd done this in my youth", then die.

Gosh, that was grim. Maybe that's what [memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori) means and does? I'll stick with "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take".

Anyways, take more risks, and maybe you'll get lucky.

## Exceptions

Just make myself clear again, don't take this post and spend your life savings in the stock market. Make sure you know what you're getting into before jumping at the opportunity.

There are still some cases where it's very likely not a good idea to bet on. These cases typically involve one or more of:

- physical safety: e.g. if going south means you would get thrown out of your house. For these cases, either don't risk it and wait, or have a solid backup plan (e.g. a trusted friend's place, social services, helplines).
- financial security: e.g. if you want to build a start-up, make sure you have enough money to support you to find a job if it fails.
- mental well-being: e.g. if you're considering coming out but expect your family to harass you for the rest of your time there, maybe it's safer to keep it a secret. You're still valid even if you haven't told others üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà‚ù§Ô∏è

Yes, risk more often than you think, but know your odds and your failsafes if it goes badly.
