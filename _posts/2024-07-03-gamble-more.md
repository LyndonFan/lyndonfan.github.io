Okay, I could have called this post "Take More Risks", but it's a bit less exciting, innit?

I've taken some risks more than usual lately, and often they weren't that bad. Knowing there are some people who are less likely to take risks and/or are conservative (no not the party), I've got some anecdotes for you to think about.

## Once in a Lifetime

_Come, one and all, to the best roulette tables you can find in the whole world!_

Some opportunities do happen very rarely in your life, like [the massive spike in solar activity that allowed people in the UK to see the northern lights](LINK). I only heard about it at 12:30 that night, but eventually decided it was worth a shot. I couldn't drive to a remote field to try seeing it wiht my naked eye, but after an hour of fumbling around and realising I need to set my camera with longer exposure, I got some photos of the Aurora on my phone, taken just in my neighbourhood.

Or maybe it's one of your friends from years ago who went to study in the US, and is now visiting Oxford. It took me a while to start contacting them, but during the night out we caught up with each other, and I took them around the place where I studied and used to call home. I also got soem nice bubble tea out of it so it was a good bonus. 

These opportunities don't come very often, but when they do, you do know they are hard to get by. Sometimes the news just tells you, but more often you can figure it out. [Maybe it's a career change, maybe it's going to a prestigious university, or maybe it's starting your adult life in a another country](./2024-03-13-big-changes.md). If you go for it, it'd be quite hard to undo your decision. But if you do, things might work out for you, you might just...

## Win Big

_Win one of our many covented prizes!_

Look at the payout table carefully. Find the prizes with a decent chance of them. If any of them look very attractive, you might just want to go for it.

Back when I was a ~~wee kid~~ high schooler, I never really considered going overseas to study. I was a bright kid, but I aims were set in local univerisities. They were good even worldwide, but definitely not known by everyone like Harvard or Cambridge. Imagine the surprise I had on my face when one of my teachers suggested I should apply to Oxford! After a few rounds of persuation, I did decide to go along with it. So for the upcoming summer, my teachers and school franctically whipped up a good personal statement for UCAS, prepared me for the aptitude tests and interviews. Eventually, I got a conditional offer, and was overjoyed. It was definitely a life changing prize.

## Nothing to Lose

_Our tickets are cheaper than you think!_

The costs of taking on a risk sound hefty, but often are not.

The most common costs are time and money. Money can often be recovered or saved from other places, so (personally) should not be an issue as long as it's reasonable. Time can't be recovered easily, but if weren't planning to do anything with it, going for an chance encounter is arguably saving the lost time.

I used to not really do anything outside of work. Buy some groceries, clean the house, and maybe meet up with my friends once a while. But overall it was a bit dull. Last summer, I found a D&D session organised by the local board game shop, and decided to go for it. It was pretty fun, and through it I learnt there are sessions hostly weekly in a pub in the city center. I decided to go to one, and now it's part of my schedule. It wasn't free, it was all I did for my Tuesday evenings, but it was more fun than staying at home and binging Youtube.

Another occassion was when I wanted to attend a PyData event hosted by my friend (hi [Tom](https://github.com/TomBurdge)!) in Cambridge. It was in the evening on a workday and quite a distance away (train tickets aren't cheap), but through persuading my boss and my friend, I got to leave work early and stay at his place afterwards. On top of achieving my 

Sometimes, the worst thing you'd get is a "no", and everyone moves on.

## Playing is its Own Reward

_Just by joining, you're already part of the spectacle!_

Satistically, you can't win every single time. That's just how probability works.

However, you _can_ often get away a consolation prize, and it's often called "learning a lesson". You might fail a job interview, but preparing for it can help you across your job search, and its assignment can be good practice for your coding and problem solving skills. You might go to a networking event and not make any connections, but you still probably talked to multiple people, and it will likely prepare you for other social encounters. <!--What do you mean small talk is easy?--> Didn't win anything in a hackathon? You already took part in a 24-hour adrenaline-fueled event with food, stash, accomodation, and entertainment. Also you know what others have done to win.

Even if you don't get to play again, it could still be an invaluable experience. I only applied to Oxford when one of my teachers encouraged me, and eventually received an invitiation to have the final interviews in person. It was my first visit to the UK, and I was captivated by the snow when I arrived in Oxford. I also got to live in _the_ Oxford colleges! I reckon even if I didn't get into Oxford, it was still a tale to look back on.

## \<call-to-action>

_So what are you waiting for? Go bet on it!_

Risks often turn people away due to their nature, but the reward could be worth it. A good portion of times you'll get something out of it, and it might be life changing. To put it another way, you don't want to be on your deathbed, utter, "I wish I'd done this in my youth", then die.

Gosh, that was grim. Maybe that's what [memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori) means and does to you?

Anyways, take more risks, and maybe you'll get lucky.

## Exceptions

Just make myself clear again, don't take this post and spend your life savings in the stock market. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into before jumping at the opportunity.

There are still some cases where it's very likely not a good idea to bet on. These cases typically involve one or more of:

- physical safety: e.g. if you would get thrown out of your house if it goes badly for you. If these cases, either don't risk it, or have a solid backup plan (e.g. a trusted friend's house, social services, helplines).
- financial security: e.g. if you want to build a start up, make sure you have enough money to support you to find a job if the start up fails.
- mental well-being: e.g. if you were to come out but expect your family to berate you for the rest of your time there, maybe it's safer to keep it a secret. You're still valid even if you haven't told anyone else :heart: 

Yes, risk more often than you think, but know your odds and any fallback plans if it goes badly.
