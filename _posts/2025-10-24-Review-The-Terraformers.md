Recently I read The Terraformers by Annalee Newitz. It's a good Sci-fi book!

## What's it about?

You initially follow Destry, who's working to keep the environment in balance on a new planet ... under a real estate company. It _mostly_ goes without mishaps, until they find some unexpected inhabitants. The rest of the book follows different members of the team as they deal with the fallout.

## Spoiler free review

The best bit about the book is definitely the world building. It's very imaginative, yet slowly places its blocks. By the last quarter of the book you will be following along in terms of things that would sound ridiculous to an outsider -- but in a good way!

There are some time skips in the story, but it does show the development over a long time. It's called "The Terraformers", so it'll be weird if the place transformed overnight, or even just over a decade. There are also good ties between the parts, and when I re-read it I saw the hints / foreshadowing better.

There are some romantic subplots which relate but aren't the actual storylines. Sometimes the scenes get a bit queasy for me, but scan the pages to get the gist and I think not much is lost.

Speaking of the characters, they're not bad! (I couldn't find a better adjective -- that's why I'm not an author.) They feel at least two-dimensional, and have interests and opinions outside of the main occupation they're introduced as. 
There's also good non-binary representation in both "robotic" and "organic" characters, and it doesn't hit you on the head with it. (Mostly "yeah they exist in the world and people don't complain about it.")

Of course, this wouldn't be a good sci-fi book without some nice Easter eggs.

## Review with Spoilers

Spoiler gap if you want to read the book yourself first!

(You're here!)

Again, the world building is bloody amazing. It slowly eases you into the idea of expanding the definition of "people": first just humans, then Archea (humanoid), and ending with the typical robot / "animal". By part 3 the main characters are a train and a cat. I also felt natural and nodding along with the extension. If the book started with this I'll probably be like "yeah this is a weird start, I'm just going to put this down and find another book."

Splitting the whole book into 3 main stories wasn't a bad choice. Each part showcases how far Sask-E has evolved, and the maps at the start of each part are a good indicator as well. Each story has clear arcs:

- Destry as someone who's initially just doing her job to literally bargaining her future away for Spider City to exist
- Sulfur to initially hating Meesha to liking him and falling in love (okay I lied a bit about the romantic sublot not tying into main storyline) and getting him onboard to making the trains autonomous
- Scrubjay from initially just liking to carry passengers around to realising the horrors of people outside of Spider City experience.

The arcs and characters also don't overstay their welcome: the first part ends after the contract is signed, and the second part ends after they decided to grow trains as the means of transportation.

The callbacks / foreshadowing are nice and help me link back to existing parts: the {pub name}

The romance / sex scene subplots are ... alright? I think the first and third parts do it right with artistic description -- and yes, even the naked people dancing along poles is something I'd give a pass. But describing the fabric to put on someone's body for pleasure? The author is definitely being sex positive, but maybe a bit much for me.

(blushes, flips pages along) ...Anyway!

The bridges between parts are good breaks which (a) showcase what Verdance / Emerald are thinking, and (b) introduce characters down the line. They are written as reactions to what our main cast were doing over the last section, so feel like nice .

The Easter eggs were good choices too: the travelling ~~salesman~~ herbivore problem, and Sunbuilders as a Civilisation-like game (I haven't played civ before, don't @ me).

Some of the conversations / quotes are great:

- good quotes, especially from first story
	- (definition of bargain)
	- (destry's moose partner when first removed limiter)

And when Whistle was asked how he felt after his limiter was removed

> Still, it turned out the one he wanted was something he could have said all along: _It feels like rage._
>
> Midnight hung her head. _Are you mad at me?_
> 
> _Not you. Everyone. Everything. It’s like I’ve been waiting to get angry for a really long time, and now I can finally do it._
> 
> "I'm so sorry, Whistle." Destry had sidled around to stand beside Midnight in his line of sight. "Those wormy InAss ratings --"
> 
> Whistle cut her off: _You know I'm just as intelligent as I always was, right? The only difference is now you have to listen to me._

It's almost like a reverse LLM, though it probably wasn't a thing when they initially wrote it. If anything, this shows it's relatable!

- relevant to current news!
	- poor people being treated, erm, poorly by companies / corporations
	- housing crisis

## Second Opinion from a Friend

I liked it so much that I recommended it to a friend and gave him the book! And asked him to return it later -- I borrowed it from the library.

Some of his opinions:

- The world was so imaginative that he couldn't picture it in his head. (Which is what he's supposed to be able to do in his day job, so it speaks more volume.)
- It relates to a variety of real world situations
- The book is possibly too optimistic? Such as between setting of organic + inorganic people. (But hey it's fiction :shrug:)
- "I don't want to know how the train and the cat get on with it"

So yeah, it was nice!
