## What is Pydata? What are these meetups?

## The Talks

There were two main talks, followed by two quick ones. I'll summarize them and share my quick two-cents.

### Distributional Forecasts for Time Series

(TALK SUMMARY HERE)

The talk was quite interesting, though very technical -- going over the formal definitions of what proper scoring and showing integrals. It's necessary, but around 60% of the people (estimated with sample size less than 10) might have lost the plot. Still, I might keep the ideas around the next time I have to deal with a time series.

### DIY ChatGPT

(TALK SUMMARY HERE)

(include link to the repo)

The title is obviously eye-catching, and the results did speak for themselves. There was an interesting hiccup where the host's Wi-Fi blocked access to ChatGPT, so some of the demo was shown with precomputed results on GitHub instead. If anything, like Jon said, it shows the need for hosting the LLM locally. As for the demo, I'm impressed by how clean the webpage looks with a few lines of Streamlit, and how Langchain hides away a lot of baggage of interacting with LLMs. I might give the LLMs a shot, but I'll definitely use Streamlit as the frontend of my next data science project.

### Open Source is Illegal

(TALK SUMMARY HERE)

The talk was quite ambitious for a quick talk, but raised a lot of good points. His opinions were something I can get behind: a developer shouldn't be sued for being the only person to maintain an open source project, but to break it without notice is a different story (cough [leftpad](www.google.com) cough).

### London Data Week

(TALK SUMMARY HERE)

Overall the concept seems nice, and I would have joined the activites if I were in London during the weekends.

## The Chats

There was a quick break between the main talks, and a pub trip after all four. There was also some time before all talks but I only arrived in time to grab some pizza (yes there was free food).

### In-between Break

### Puuuub!

Yup, it's an official part of the iternary, though some people do leave before that.

Walking to a nearby pub called the Banker, we continued chatting about ourselves and our fields. I met people with different backgrounds, all with their own experiences and perspectives. It was great to discuss the tools we use, how one gets started in the field, and many more.

(include some bonus of pub trip, e.g. making it less formal and easier for ppl to have longer conversations)

## TL;DR

So there were:

-   intriguing talks
-   interesting people -- during and outside of talks
-   free food
-   bonus (and optional) pub trip

What more can I have asked for?

I'll look forward to what these meetups have in store.
