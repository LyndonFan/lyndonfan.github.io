Dear Lyndon,

Congrats on your graduation -- you have had a tough four years, with an especially challenging June. Your graduation later this month will be lovely, especially since our parents are visiting.

Oh, yes, this is me writing to yourself, one year from the future. In the unlikely event you are reading this in 2022, erm, investigate?

I digress. I'm writing (back) to you mostly to give some advice and some heads-up about your next year. I ~~won't be too personal on the public internet~~ won't spoil too much of the future so you still get to enjoy it as much as possible.

## You'll get a job

Let's start with your most pressing concern: you will find a good job, and start right after you move out. It might not be what you are looking for, but you'll know once you see it.

In the meantime, why not spend more time picking up other languages? Maybe JS/React for frontend, or C++ for once to learn about pointers? You will have time outside of work (we aren't complete workaholics), but at the start of our career, some more experience won't hurt. Keep this up after you've started too, especially since you will have a better idea of what your job needs.

## You'll pick up new hobbies

Remember the D&D campaign you joined last year but just missed the ending? That is a sign for you to go join a campaign. We're beginners, yes, but so are a lot of people. There are tonnes of online and in-person ones, so browse around.

There's also Magic, of course. You definitely won't forget it, considering you've bought tickets to Commandfest, have you? If not, yes, go buy them -- make it a treat from me üòâ Build some more decks too, since having one is only going to have limited variations. <!-- And you can't play proxies at official events üòû -->

But you don't want to have only two hobbies, do you? Find some other stuff you've thought of doing -- maybe it's a place in town, or some other stuff that's more affordable when you're technically still a student. Go do them! You only have around 1.5 months left, so do them before September. Speaking of which, ...

## You'll have time

Out of context, that's weird, but I hope you know what I mean.

For the past 4, neigh, 16 years, all we've been doing is study and study and study and study. For exams and tests and certificates and competitions. Some are useful, others are for "polishing our portfolio", and the rest are compulsory. It's not to say we did interesting things for our own sake, but a majority of it was forced in one way or another.

But you've graduated! You literally have no one else telling you what to do. Given this almost infinite freedom, you also have countless paths ahead. And you know what I picked?

The short answer: the path of least resistance.

The long answer: ehhh (whines, shrugs). Yes, despite applying for jobs, finding a place to settle, and taking care of myself, I would consider these as doing the bare minimum to survive. We're lucky that our parents will pay / paid our debt off (thanks Mum and Dad ‚ù§Ô∏è), and I get to type out my nonsense on a blog on a computer. That said, if you fast-forward to 2022 Christmas, you'll find me lying in bed, watching Youtube videos and wasting the day away. As chill as it sounds, it's not doing much. Even playing MTG or Minecraft (you have a copy from 2019/2020 Christmas, right?) probably seems more meaningful.

But you already have some thoughts about your future, don't you? You could go drink until you pass out, gamble away your fortune on the stock market, or catfish people on Tinder. Yet, I know you won't do any of them, since (a) I'm you in the future, and (b) I also know you well (shocking). You'll get to learn more about yourself and know what you don't want, hence better understand what you do want. You'll find reasons to go visit places alone and wander a bit. Mostly because there's an event, but mainly because you want to.

I know you lack a clear picture of your future, and that's because I do too. You do have a one-year head start, so give it some thought. Write down stuff, research, make plans, and achieve them. Hopefully, I get to piggyback off your efforts and reap the rewards.

## Quickfire round

Oh, you'll also get to

-   see Magic in unexpected places
-   visit your parents
-   have your parents visit
-   watch a film that's extremely imaginative
-   go bowling, and
-   get a surprise (hint, it's a surprise)

## TL;DR

I could go on for a long time -- so long that you become me. But know you have good 365 days ahead of you, alright?

Take care of yourself, spend your time well, and I'll see you in a year.

Regards,

Lyndon
