Dear Lyndon,

Congrats for your graduation -- you have had a tough four years, with an especially challenging June. Your graduation later this month will be lovely, especially since our parents are visiting.

Oh, yes, this is me writing to yourself, one year from the future. In the unlikely event you are reading this in 2022, erm, investigate?

I disgress. I'm writing back to you mostly to give some advice, and some heads-up about your next year. I ~~won't be too personal on the public internet~~ won't spoil too much of the future so you still get to enjoy it as much as possible.

<!--
things to describe/hint at
- will get job
- will see family next year -- both in HK and UK

things to say
- spend time more meaningfully
- learn proper language -- JS/react for frontend? C++ for once? some unique yet used languages??
- maintain and expand your hobbies -- MTG, and D&D? something artsy / creative?
- start finding your purpose. no need to come up with answer quick, but plan where you see yourself in near future. includes all aspects

end with quickfire round of things you'll do

 -->
