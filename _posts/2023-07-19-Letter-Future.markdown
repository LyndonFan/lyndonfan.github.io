Dear Lyndon,

Hope your past year has went well. In case you forgot, I wrote this last year to catch up and see how things went for you / will go for me. It's also to see what you have or have not done since I wrote this letter -- sort of like a review, but between myself (or myselves?) ~~and all the readers~~.

<!--
career / more coding related
- what languages can profressionally use? Python (ofc), but anything else? JS/React for frontend? C++/Go for speed? sth else?
- what tools? GCP?
- what show work? certs? projects? open source stuff? this blog?

personal / smol stuff related
- MTG? D&D? other games / hobbies?
- socialize w/ friends? family? new friends?
- stay in touch w/ community? local one, and HKers? volunteer?

big stuff
- what person you want to be? any direction?
- set goals? plans of action? accountability? deadlines?
- habits? maintain good ones? start new ones? rid bad ones?


## WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU LOOKED AT THEM?
- "I know you -- I'm literally you. There's a decent chance you haven't looked at whatever you wrote until I brought it up in the last couple paragraphs."
- check regularly
- put them in prominent place -- in room, computer, and/or phone
- how track? Notion/Obsidean? calendar? physical notebook? sth else?

## conclusion
- "Look, it's all a lot, but I hope you remember where I'm coming from. Our lives have changed a lot -- from coming to the UK for university, to the pandemic, to graduating and starting a job. You are a 24-year-old adult, and only you can be responsible for your own life and your happiness."
- not all done in one day
- "hey, it's a review. I'm not giving you a score out of 100, just comments and guidelines for you to look back on yourself."
- have time to improve yourself.
- "Do whatever makes me, and hence yourself, happy."
