Dear Lyndon,

Hope your past year has gone well. In case you forgot, I wrote this last year to catch up and see how things went for you / will go for me. It's also to evaluate what you have or have not done since I wrote this letter -- sort of like a review, but between myself (or myselves?) ~~and all the readers~~.

## Career progress

I'm assuming you are still in a coding-related career. If not, let me know!

### What can you use?

If someone told you to use some language for a project, do you need to find the docs to print "Hello World"? (If it's Haskell probably.) What languages other than Python can you use professionally? Maybe it's Javascript/Typescript plus some frontend framework, C++/Go for speed, or something else entirely.

Outside of programming languages, there are tools and platforms for setting up the project/software, e.g. Terraform, docker, and Google Cloud Platform. What experiences do you have with them?

On a similar note, ...

### What have you accomplished?

Nowadays, writing "X years of experience with Y" on your CV just isn't convincing. You need proof that you have used it -- what is yours? Listing out your achievements at work is a great starting point, but having actual projects and code for others to view is better. Showcase repos you are particularly proud of, or certificates you spent months working towards. Or even [this blog](/_site/index.html)!

## Social life

Don't let the above swamp you though: life isn't just about advancing up the career/corporate ladder. You don't want someone to tell you to "Go get a life", because that's me until recently.

### What are your hobbies?

You shouldn't spend more than a minute to think of your answer.
I'm still playing [Magic](https://magic.wizards.com/en) and some [D&D](https://dnd.wizards.com/), how about you? Have you picked up other hobbies or interests?

### How do you spend your time?

Outside of hobbies and work, what else are you doing? Just staying inside your room isn't exactly healthy, so go outside and touch some grass. Are you going to any local events? If you're invested, try volunteering for them!

### What's your support network?

For me (now), it means my friends and parents. When you're down or have troubles, who can you rely on? Some problems are fundamentally out of our reach (e.g. getting career advice), and others will be much easier with the aid of others (e.g. moving to a new house). With the power of friendship/love ðŸŒˆ, you should be able to solve them much easier.

## Big stuff

Let's get onto the actual business, shall we?

### What kind of person do you want to be?

A concrete answer isn't necessary (I'd be surprised if you found it within a year), but you are likely to have found some general direction. I already have some ideas of where I don't want to head towards (e.g. a ditch or [salted fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_salted_fish#:~:text=The%20Hong%20Kong%20blockbuster%20Shaolin,cited%20in%20publications%20as%20such.)), so don't say you had nothing to work to.

### What goals do you have?

Yes, I've put goals after identity. I'm reading [James Clear's Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/) and incorporating the goal-setting section here.

Given your directions/identity, you should have some corresponding goals. Make sure they are measurable and set forth plans and deadlines. Get yourself accountable to actually do them.

Similarly, what habits have you set out to do/get rid of? Are you making them easier/harder to achieve? What about existing good ones?

You almost surely made plans for the above, which is a good start. However, ...

<div align="center">
<h2>When was the last time you looked at them?</h2>
</div>

I know you -- I'm literally you. There's a decent chance you haven't looked at whatever you wrote until I brought them up in the last couple of paragraphs.

Check them regularly, and put them in prominent places. I currently have some A4 paper with (questionable) motivational text hung at my desk. You could have them on your computer(s) and phone(s).

Better yet, track them. There are tonnes of apps out there, or even Notion (or Obsidian?) to help with this. A physical calendar or notebook would work just as well.

## Final words

Look, it's all a lot, but I hope you remember where I'm coming from. Our lives have changed drastically over the past 5 years: from coming to the UK for university to surviving the pandemic, from applying for internships to starting your first full-time job. You are a 24-year-old adult, and only you can be responsible for your own life and happiness.

Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither aren't you. You can't change who you are overnight, so have time to improve yourself. I can't judge you because time only marches forward, nor can I foresee all aspects of your life. Treat the above as merely guidelines for you to look back on yourself.

Do whatever makes me, and hence yourself, happy.

Regards,

Lyndon
